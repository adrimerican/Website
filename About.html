  <h4>Why I joined Code Nation</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>I  joined Code Nation because I wanted to pursue a career in the thing I recently grew to love.  knew coming into this that I wasn't grwa at the code itself but I wanted to learn and become better.
      I have been working a dead end job  for so long and I did not want to go to University as the thought of spending another three years training in a degree, that I'd probably never use did not appeal to me.
      I was never great at the art of essays and working on things that did not interest me. It was extremely obvious when I had an interest for something and when I didn't care.
      Code is something that relit a spark in me and made me feel curious once again. 
      So I decided to learn and delve further into the world and industry of technology and well here I am!
